and audience reach we will change our tactics each time to grow and reach more people a social media campaign is a coordinated marketing effort that uses one or more social media platforms to reinforce or assist with a business goal campaigns differ from everyday social media efforts in that they are more focused targeted and measurable the goal of competitor analysis is to equip you with insights to inform your product development and marketing decisions the first stage in designing your social media strategy is determining your objectives maybe you want people to know more about your brand or maybe you want to create customer relationships boost traffic to your website sell your items or share special deals choose two or three top priorities and concentrate on how youll use social media for accomplishing them whatever your objectives be sure they are smart timebound specified measurable achievable and realistic establish your success metrics if you wish to increase sales leads for instance specify a 20 increase establish a target number of posts per day or per week and decide how many likes shares or comments you want for each one if you want to increase exposure to your company or product if your company already employs social media evaluate how well it is currently serving your needs using the objectives and criteria you established in step 1 are your objectives being met if so you might want to think about raising the bar if not the moment has come to determine why consider the platforms you are utilising even if you just have a small amount of time to dedicate to social media you dont have to be present on every single one finding the areas where you are most successful and concentrating your efforts there is significantly preferable next evaluate whether your posts are accomplishing your goals do your posts reach your intended audience or are they being ignored analyse your site and post traffic using analytics to see which content kinds are most and least popular in step 2 you will have already begun considering the platforms you want to employ now think about whether they fit the profile of your audience youll have the most potential reach on linkedin however if you offer services to business professionals you could wish to establish a presence on other social media on the other hand if you work in the interior design fashion or another lifestyle area pinterest or instagram might be more fruitful no matter how many social media platforms you join or posts you write you wont be able to keep your audiences attention without quality content your material should be adapted to the platform you are using as well as reflect the general voice and market of your company each sort of social media has its own characteristics and demands from online culture to the number of characters in a post consider where you want to place your brand are you trying to entertain or educate your audience are a blog article or white paper more likely to elicit a response from your audience than an image or infographic the audience youre trying to reach is probably swamped with content from other businesses and your rivals always strive to create material that is interesting relevant and deserving of their attention they wont read it if you arent going to take time out of your busy day to do it remember that there are various theories regarding what functions best its important to observe what your successful competitors are doing on social media including the platforms they utilise how frequently they post and their vocal tone examine their habits and modify them for your business but test out several forms of content instead of just going with your soul on this there is no ideal time that works for every organisation so choosing when to post requires a great deal of subjectivity when you post let your audience be the driver determine when they are most active and likely to be interested in interacting with you by keeping an eye on their online behaviours if your audience is international you might want to plan postings at different times of the day to accommodate different time zones you must also choose how frequently to post you run the danger of spamming your followers and losing them if you publish too frequently you could lose business if you dont update frequently enough to attract their attention trial and error is the best method to choose the proper frequency reduce the quantity of postings if you are posting 15 times per day and are losing followers post more frequently on the other hand if you just post once per day and dont attract followers consistency is crucial posting erratically can give the impression that youre unreliable or disorganised you can use an editorial calendar to plan out your pieces and keep track of information like deadlines networks content types keywords titles and status microsoft excel may be used to make a straightforward calendar but the more specific your timetable the more unified your social media plan will be it takes time and effort to implement a social media plan so unless you have a lot of free time think about hiring someone to assist you a designated social media manager or your team as a whole may be in charge of establishing and maintaining your social media presence but whoever you involve make sure they are aware of the type of online presence you are attempting to build and provide them with the instruction required to publish and update in your personal tone if blogging is a part of your plan be sure that it is written and edited by professionals otherwise you run the danger of damaging your brand making scheduled articles is only one aspect of maintaining an online presence you also need to cultivate relationships as a result be sure to allot enough time to read your followers comments and answer to them the social media world moves quickly its critical that you always evaluate and reevaluate how your plan is working because whats popular now will be obsolete tomorrow utilise site statistics such as facebook insights to track your progress towards your objectives and see how specific postings are doing however resist the need to focus all of your efforts on gaining more followers likes and shares high levels of engagement are beneficial but keep your strategy concentrated on the connection between your activities and your corporate objectives engagement will reveal how well your material is received by your audience but it is insufficient to generate income find techniques to gauge for instance how many leads you received from social media or how many people noticed your sponsored linkedin ad and visited your company website we publish our newsletter with the most up to date information

service for you with our dedicated account managers and executives email marketing is the key resource for engaging more clients in a short time additionally it enables you to get more leads and sales a cold email is one sent to someone with whom you have no prior relationship cold emails serve a legitimate business purpose and make relevant offers to targeted prospects which distinguishes them from spam except for the medium there is little difference between a cold email and a cold call and cold emailing is usually much easier at scale in both cases youre contacting a stranger establishing a personal connection and attempting to achieve a businessrelated goal and if the outcome is clearly beneficial to your recipients as well chances are youll be successful we administrate different types of cold emails campaigns based our clients necessaty and each of them has its way of tergating customer and success wthis is based on the premise of introducing yourself to the recipient as the name suggests you may be tempted to sell your product or service similar to how a marketer is trained to do during a cold call although it would be simple to work in a soft sell this is not what you want resist the temptation this email aims to strengthen relationships and please remember that youre not stepping in for the sale right now simply introduce yourself provide more information about yourself and begin the process of making business acquaintances in this cold email if everything goes as planned such as a followup email or social media connection you can continue to nurture and advance the relationship a sale or promotional email email can help you gain the confidence you need it is all about persuading someone to make a purchase in the near future you are not sending this cold email to develop a relationship over time you do it because you want to make a sale as soon as possible businesses can advertise their goods and services by sending out promotional emails promotional emails often aim to turn subscribers into customers and existing customers into brand champions as opposed to transactional emails which tell customers about their order or account information a sale or promotional email strategy will never be completely successful but there are things you can say to increase your open and response rates there are many types of promotional email categories among them genz follows the follofing categories exuberant excitement is a common characteristic in hardsell presentations with the goal being to make the prospective buyer appear just as enthused about the product as the salesperson they are frequently stuffed with information designed to overwhelm a customer with all the advantages of buying the suggested product for instance a car salesman will frequently list all the extra or luxury features of a car in an effort to make purchasing the automobile seem almost irresistible a hardsell strategy is often used to convince customers to buy a product on the basis of logic by providing them with several justifications for why or how using the product will enhance their lives for instance the salesperson could give arguments such how owning the product will save the customer time how it is simpler to use and how it is less expensive than a similar product the hurry and emphasis on making an immediate purchase that define a hard sale are conspicuously absent from a soft sell in contrast to the hard sell practise of providing various facts and logical justifications for purchasing a product it also tends to be a more emotive presentation additionally compared to a hard sell a soft sell makes far fewer overt attempts to close the deal in fact some soft sell ads are so deceptive that there isnt even a clear attempt to convince the buyer to buy the product although the advertisement may go into great detail about the product it doesnt make any direct sales pitches beyond listing the stores or websites where the product can be purchased would you immediately push your product or service if you attended a conference or spoke with someone on the phone most likely not even if you believe you can make a sale it may cast a negative light on you instead you begin by introducing yourself and then give a soft pitch about yourself and your company although email differs from inperson or phone conversations it is often preferable to avoid hard sell tactics in favor of something more informative if you find a good soft sell email you can use it to start the conversation this will eventually lead to you feeling more confident in asking for the sale test it in your email campaign and see how it goes when you combine the best of social media and email the results of your email campaign can be spectacular there are opportunities to incorporate this into your cold email strategy regardless of your preferred social media platform it is not possible to respond to every social media request with an email this isnt something youll do every time but its a strategy to use when you really want to build a relationship with someone while also experimenting with your email campaign do you know anyone who knows someone who knows someone when prospecting for new business your network can provide numerous advantages some consider name dropping to be a deadly strategy while others believe it is impolite if you want to give it a shot a cold email is the way to go the truth is that mentioning your name increases your credibility the individual believes you because they know someone in your network furthermore because of who you know the person is more likely to respond to your email name dropping can significantly improve the response rate of your cold email strategy if you named the person in the subject line of your email this will result in a higher open rate when you combine the best of social media and email the results of your email campaign can be spectacular there are opportunities to incorporate this into your cold email strategy regardless of your preferred social media platform even the worlds greatest business minds seek assistance from others they are aware of their flaws and are not afraid to enlist the assistance of others inquiring for advice via email can help you build a relationship the person may be flattered that you approached them for assistance this gives you a strong foundation for moving the conversation forward this email is short sweet and to the point you ask two direct questions expecting two direct answers if youre lucky the person will give you useful advice if youre really lucky they might even volunteer to answer a phone call provide detailed feedback or even provide you with personal assistance as a mentor in this case the ideal response would be something like can you send me your proposal andor manuscript for review even if this does not occur any response is a step in the right direction if you consider yourself an expert on a particular subject you can provide free advice to prospects by leveraging your expertise we understand you have a lot on your plate we know you have a lot of work to do however offering free advice now could lead to a lucrative deal later on it is simple to put together this type of email you must include the following components establishing a relationship can be facilitated by requesting advice in an email the fact that you asked for assistance may have made them feel honoured you now have a firm foundation on which to further the dialogue the call to action or cta is one of the most crucial elements when developing an email marketing campaign a calltoaction email button piques a subscribers interest and prods them to take action ctas are a crucial component of an email marketers toolkit the difference between good and exceptional emails may be found in these straightforward but effective buttons because an email regardless of the campaign it is utilised in should continue a dialogue or engagement between a business and a customer an email should contain at least one cta to encourage interaction whether a brand is sending out a newsletter thanking a user for a purchase or reminding a customer about their full cart despite being necessary these buttons are not always the simplest components to embed there are many types of ctas like shop now shop our fall collection shop now get 50 off shop our best sellers act now save today buy now buy now pay later buy it today etc we publish our newsletter with the most up to date information regularly please suscribe it to

processing of personal information from european union residents eu the uk regulator in charge of the data protection act 2018 the general data protection regulation and the privacy and electronic communications ec directive regulations 2003 is the information commissioners office the ico is like the data protection police and we must always stay on their good side gdpr compliance must be taken seriously because the penalties for noncompliance are punitive and designed to be painful most marketing formats now heavily rely on the use of customer data gdpr is a set of rules that govern the circumstances and manner in which data can be legally processed it also introduces some frightening consequences for breaking the law the gdpr also establishes a framework for determining which types of data are considered private and should be treated as such the gdprsavvy term for private data is personally identifiable information pii the amount of pii stored within most businesses systems astounds them often without any specific intent or purpose no not always the gdpr regulates how we collect store and process personal data consent is one of the lawful bases for processing personal data under gdpr but there are others you may be able to use legitimate interests to justify collecting storing and processing personal data in particular when it comes to data use for marketing purposes and consent issues the relevant framework is actually pecr b2b marketing communications regulations are generally less stringent under pecr and consent is not required in b2b scenarios you must exercise caution in terms of who you target and the types of messages you send but that is where we come in our approach is 100 gdpr and pecr compliant i highly recommend dr shah siddiqui as a
